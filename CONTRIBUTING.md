# Contributing
## Commit message format:
`[#xxx] <message>`  
Where `xxx` is the issue number the commit references.  
This format is enforced by our pre-commit hooks, so before commiting anything to the repository, please install our pre-commit hooks by running:  
## Installing pre-commit
`pip install pre-commit`  
or use your package manager of choice.

## Installing the hooks
`pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg --hook-type pre-commit`
