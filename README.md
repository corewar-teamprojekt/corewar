## About Corewar

[Corewar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War) is a game where two or more players write competing assembly programs in a [custom assembly language called Redcode](https://github.com/corewar-teamprojekt/corewar/wiki/Redcode), aiming to control a shared virtual memory space.

The game concept originated in 1984 and was first introduced in [this article](https://corewar.co.uk/standards/cwg.txt). Since then, a few implementations have emerged, but most have grown outdated or lack the features needed for a modern experience, especially for easily playing against friends or competing online.

This project aims to revitalize Corewar, bringing it to a whole new audience of tech enthusiasts. Happy hacking!

## Start playing
