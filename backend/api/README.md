# Corewar API

Lorem ipsum...

## Local setup
 - configured to use gradle 8.10 and jvm 22  
   -> Get yourself a matching jdk  
// Todo: write step-by-step guide

Hit localhost:8080/api with GET for a basic hello world.

## Stuff
 - The controllers should not do any direct validation. This should be delegated to the constructors of the commands!
